(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement.

to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

protection and a credit event occurs, as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Fund will either (i)receive from the seller of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and deliver the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)receive a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (2) If the Fund is a seller of protection and a credit event occurs, as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Fund will either (i)pay to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (3) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (4) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (5) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end.

The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Fund will either (i)pay to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement.

Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (5) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (6) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) If the Fund is a seller of protection and a credit event occurs, as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Fund will either (i)pay to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (4) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (5) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (6) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) If the Fund is a seller of protection and a credit event occurs, as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Fund will either (i)pay to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (4) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (5) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (6) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) If the Fund is a seller of protection and a credit event occurs, as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Fund will either (i)pay to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (4) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (5) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) If the Fund is a seller of protection and a credit event occurs, as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Fund will either (i)pay to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (4) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (5) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (6) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate, sovereign or U.S. municipal issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) If the Fund is a seller of protection and a credit event occurs, as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Fund will either (i)pay to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (4) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate, sovereign or U.S. municipal issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (5) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (6) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

seller of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and deliver the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)receive a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (2) If the Fund is a seller of protection and a credit event occurs, as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Fund will either (i)pay to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (3) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (4) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (5) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

occurs, as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Fund will either (i)pay to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (4) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (5) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Fund will either (i)pay to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate, sovereign or U.S. municipal issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) If the Fund is a seller of protection and a credit event occurs, as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Fund will either (i)pay to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (3) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate, sovereign or U.S. municipal issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (4) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (5) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

is a seller of protection and a credit event occurs, as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Fund will either (i)pay to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end.

Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (3) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (4) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (5) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on sovereign or U.S. Treasury obligation issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (4) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (5) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (4) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (5) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (4) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (5) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (4) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (5) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (3) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (4) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (5) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (3) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement.

(3) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (4) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (5) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement.

(3) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (4) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (5) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on U.S. Treasury obligation issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on U.S. Treasury obligation issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (4) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (5) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate, sovereign, U.S. municipal or U.S. Treasury obligation issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

Total Swap Agreements $ (131,286 ) $ 102,851 $ 18,262 $ (46,697 ) (1) If the Fund is a seller of protection and a credit event occurs, as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Fund will either (i)pay to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate, sovereign, U.S. municipal or U.S. Treasury obligation issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (o) Securities with an aggregate market value of $335,743 have been pledged as collateral for financial derivative instruments as governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. master agreements as of December31, 2016.

under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Fund will either (i)pay to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate, sovereign or U.S. municipal issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Fund could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate, sovereign or U.S. municipal issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement.

Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) If the Portfolio is a seller of protection and a credit event occurs, as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Portfolio will either (i)pay to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (3) The maximum potential amount the Portfolio could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on asset-backed securities and credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Portfolio could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Portfolio could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Portfolio could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

a credit event occurs, as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Portfolio will either (i)pay to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on corporate or sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Portfolio could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (3) The maximum potential amount the Portfolio could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end.

(2) If the Portfolio is a seller of protection and a credit event occurs, as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Portfolio will either (i)pay to the buyer of protection an amount equal to the notional amount of the swap and take delivery of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index or (ii)pay a net settlement amount in the form of cash, securities or other deliverable obligations equal to the notional amount of the swap less the recovery value of the referenced obligation or underlying securities comprising the referenced index. (3) The maximum potential amount the Portfolio could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (4) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on asset-backed securities serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(2) The maximum potential amount the Portfolio could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (3) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

(3) Implied credit spreads, represented in absolute terms, utilized in determining the market value of credit default swap agreements on sovereign issues as of period end serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood or risk of default for the credit derivative. The implied credit spread of a particular referenced entity reflects the cost of buying/selling protection and may include upfront payments required to be made to enter into the agreement. Wider credit spreads represent a deterioration of the referenced entitys credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement. (4) The maximum potential amount the Portfolio could be required to pay as a seller of credit protection or receive as a buyer of credit protection if a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement. (5) The prices and resulting values for credit default swap agreements on credit indices serve as an indicator of the current status of the payment/performance risk and represent the likelihood of an expected liability (or profit) for the credit derivative should the notional amount of the swap agreement be closed/sold as of the period end. Increasing market values, in absolute terms when compared to the notional amount of the swap, represent a deterioration of the referenced indices credit soundness and a greater likelihood or risk of default or other credit event occurring as defined under the terms of the agreement.

INVESTMENT VALUATION AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (a) Investment Valuation Policies The price of a Funds shares is based on the Funds net asset value (NAV). The NAV of a Fund or each of its share classes, as applicable, is determined by dividing the total value of portfolio investments and other assets, less any liabilities attributable to that Fund or class, by the total number of shares outstanding of that Fund or class. On each day that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is open, Fund shares are ordinarily valued as of the close of regular trading (NYSE Close). Information that becomes known to the Funds or their agents after the time as of which NAV has been calculated on a particular day will not generally be used to retroactively adjust the price of a security or the NAV determined earlier that day. Each Fund reserves the right to change the time its respective NAV is calculated if the Fund closes earlier, or as permitted by the SEC. For purposes of calculating NAV, portfolio securities and other assets for which market quotes are readily available are valued at market value. Market value is generally determined on the basis of official closing prices or the last reported sales prices, or if no sales are reported, based on quotes obtained from established market makers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by the Funds approved pricing services, quotation reporting systems and other third-party sources (together, Pricing Services). The Funds will normally use pricing data for domestic equity securities received shortly after the NYSE Close and do not normally take into account trading, clearances or settlements that take place after the NYSE Close. A foreign (non- U.S.) equity security traded on a foreign exchange or on more than one exchange is typically valued using pricing information from the exchange considered by the manager to be the primary exchange. A foreign (non-U.S.) equity security will be valued as of the close of trading on the foreign exchange, or the NYSE Close, if the NYSE Close occurs before the end of trading on the foreign exchange. Domestic and foreign (non-U.S.) fixed income securities, non-exchange traded derivatives, and equity options are normally valued on the basis of quotes obtained from brokers and dealers or Pricing Services using data reflecting the earlier closing of the principal markets for those securities. Prices obtained from Pricing Services may be based on, among other things, information provided by market makers or estimates of market values obtained from yield data relating to investments or securities with similar characteristics. Certain fixed income securities purchased on a delayed-delivery basis are marked to market daily until settlement at the forward settlement date. Exchange- traded options, except equity options, futures and options on futures are valued at the settlement price determined by the relevant exchange. Swap agreements are valued on the basis of bid quotes obtained from brokers and dealers or market-based prices supplied by Pricing Services or other pricing sources. The Funds investments in open-end management investment companies, other than exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are valued at the NAVs of such investments. If a foreign (non-U.S.) equity securitys value has materially changed after the close of the securitys primary exchange or principal market but before the NYSE Close, the security may be valued at fair value based on procedures established and approved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust (the Board). Foreign (non-U.S.) equity securities that do not trade when the NYSE is open are also valued at fair value. With respect to foreign (non-U.S.) equity securities, the Fund may determine the fair value of investments based on information provided by Pricing Services and other third-party vendors, which may recommend fair value or adjustments with reference to other securities, indices or assets. In considering whether fair valuation is required and in determining fair values, the Fund may, among other things, consider significant events (which may be considered to include changes in the value of U.S. securities or securities indices) that occur after the close of the relevant market and before the NYSE Close. A Fund may utilize modeling tools provided by third-party vendors to determine fair values of non-U.S. securities. Foreign exchanges may permit trading in foreign (non-U.S.) equity securities on days when the Trust is not open for business, which may result in a Funds portfolio investments being affected when shareholders are unable to buy or sell shares. Senior secured floating rate loans for which an active secondary market exists to a reliable degree will be valued at the mean of the last available bid/ask prices in the market for such loans, as provided by a Pricing Service. Senior secured floating rate loans for which an active secondary market does not exist to a reliable degree will be valued at fair value, which is intended to approximate market value. In valuing a senior secured floating rate loan at fair value, the factors considered may include, but are not limited to, the following: (a)the creditworthiness of the borrower and any intermediate participants, (b)the terms of the loan, (c)recent prices in the market for similar loans, if any, and (d)recent prices in the market for instruments of similar quality, rate, period until next interest rate reset and maturity. Investments valued in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates obtained from Pricing Services. As a result, the value of such investments and, in turn, the NAV of the Funds shares may be affected by changes in the value of currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. The value of investments traded in markets outside the United States or denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar may be affected significantly on a day that the Trust is not open for business. As a result, to the extent that a Fund holds foreign (non-U.S.) investments, the value of those investments may change at times when shareholders are unable to buy or sell shares and the value of such investments will be reflected in the Funds next calculated NAV. Investments for which market quotes or market based valuations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board or persons acting at their direction. The Board has adopted methods for valuing securities and other assets in circumstances where market quotes are not readily available, and has delegated to the Adviser the responsibility for applying the fair valuation methods. In the event that market quotes or market based valuations are not readily available, and the security or asset cannot be valued pursuant to a Board approved valuation method, the value of the security or asset will be determined in good faith by the Valuation Oversight Committee of the Board (Valuation Oversight Committee), generally based on recommendations provided by the Adviser. Market quotes are considered not readily available in circumstances where there is an absence of current or reliable market-based data (e.g., trade information, bid/ask information, indicative market quotations (Broker Quotes), Pricing Services prices), including where events occur after the close of the relevant market, but prior to the NYSE Close, that materially affect the values of a Funds securities or assets. In addition, market quotes are considered not readily available when, due to extraordinary circumstances, the exchanges or markets on which the securities trade do not open for trading for the entire day and no other market prices are available. The Board has delegated to the Adviser the responsibility for monitoring significant events that may materially affect the values of the Funds securities or assets and for determining whether the value of the applicable securities or assets should be reevaluated in light of such significant events. When a Fund uses fair valuation to determine the value of a portfolio security or other asset for purposes of calculating its NAV, such investments will not be priced on the basis of quotes from the primary market in which they are traded, but rather may be priced by another method that the Board or persons acting at their direction believe reflects fair value. Fair valuation may require subjective determinations about the value of a security. While the Trusts policy is intended to result in a calculation of the Funds NAV that fairly reflects security values as of the time of pricing, the Trust cannot ensure that fair values determined by the Board or persons acting at their direction would accurately reflect the price that a Fund could obtain for a security if it were to dispose of that security as of the time of pricing (for instance, in a forced or distressed sale). The prices used by a Fund may differ from the value that would be realized if the securities were sold. The Funds use of fair valuation may also help to deter stale price arbitrage as discussed under the Abusive Trading Practices section in each Funds prospectus. (b) Fair Value Hierarchy U.S. GAAP describes fair value as the price that a Fund would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation methods and requires disclosure of the fair value hierarchy, separately for each major category of assets and liabilities, that segregates fair value measurements into levels (Level 1, 2, or 3). The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risks associated with investing in those securities. Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows: Level 1Quoted prices in active markets or exchanges for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2Significant other observable inputs, which may include, but are not limited to, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are active, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities (such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates) or other market corroborated inputs. Level 3Significant unobservable inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances, to the extent observable inputs are not available, which may include assumptions made by the Board or persons acting at their direction that are used in determining the fair value of investments. Any assets or liabilities categorized as Level1 or 2 as of period end that have been transferred between Levels 1 and 2 since the prior period are due to changes in the method utilized in valuing the investments. Transfers from Level1 to Level2 are a result of a change, in the normal course of business, from the use of an exchange traded price or a trade price on the initial purchase date (Level 1) to valuation methods used by Pricing Services including valuation adjustments applied to certain securities that are solely traded on a foreign exchange to account for the market movement between the close of the foreign market and the close of the NYSE (Level 2). Assets or liabilities categorized as Level2 or 3 as of period end have been transferred between Levels 2 and 3 since the prior period due to changes in the method utilized in valuing the investments. Transfers from Level2 to Level3 are a result of a change, in the normal course of business, from the use of valuation methods used by Pricing Services (Level 2) to the use of a Broker Quote or valuation technique which utilizes significant unobservable inputs due to an absence of current or reliable market-based data (Level 3). Transfers from Level3 to Level2 are a result of the availability of current and reliable market-based data provided by Pricing Services or other valuation techniques which utilize significant observable inputs. In accordance with the requirements of U.S. GAAP, the amounts of transfers between Levels 1 and 2 and transfers into and out of Level3, if material, are disclosed in the Notes to Schedule of Investments for each respective Fund. For fair valuations using significant unobservable inputs, U.S. GAAP requires a reconciliation of the beginning to ending balances for reported fair values that presents changes attributable to realized gain (loss), unrealized appreciation (depreciation), purchases and sales, accrued discounts (premiums), and transfers into and out of the Level3 category during the period. The end of period value is used for the transfers between Levels of a Funds assets and liabilities. Additionally, U.S. GAAP requires quantitative information regarding the significant unobservable inputs used in the determination of fair value of assets or liabilities categorized as Level3 in the fair value hierarchy. In accordance with the requirements of U.S. GAAP, a fair value hierarchy, and if material, a Level3 reconciliation and details of significant unobservable inputs, have been included in the Notes to Schedules of Investments for each respective Fund. (c) Valuation Techniques and the Fair Value Hierarchy Level1 and Level2 trading assets and trading liabilities, at fair value The valuation methods (or techniques) and significant inputs used in determining the fair values of portfolio securities or other assets and liabilities categorized as Level1 and Level2 of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Fixed income securities including corporate, convertible and municipal bonds and notes, U.S. government agencies, U.S. treasury obligations, sovereign issues, bank loans, convertible preferred securities and non-U.S. bonds are normally valued on the basis of quotes obtained from brokers and dealers or Pricing Services that use broker-dealer quotations, reported trades or valuation estimates from their internal pricing models. The Pricing Services internal models use inputs that are observable such as issuer details, interest rates, yield curves, prepayment speeds, credit risks/spreads, default rates and quoted prices for similar assets. Securities that use similar valuation techniques and inputs as described above are categorized as Level2 of the fair value hierarchy. Fixed income securities purchased on a delayed-delivery basis or as a repurchase commitment in a sale-buyback transaction are marked to market daily until settlement at the forward settlement date and are categorized as Level2 of the fair value hierarchy. Mortgage-related and asset-backed securities are usually issued as separate tranches, or classes, of securities within each deal. These securities are also normally valued by Pricing Services that use broker-dealer quotations, reported trades or valuation estimates from their internal pricing models. The pricing models for these securities usually consider tranche-level attributes, current market data, estimated cash flows and market-based yield spreads for each tranche, and incorporate deal collateral performance, as available. Mortgage-related and asset-backed securities that use similar valuation techniques and inputs as described above are categorized as Level2 of the fair value hierarchy. Common stocks, ETFs, exchange-traded notes and financial derivative instruments, such as futures contracts, rights and warrants, or options on futures that are traded on a national securities exchange, are stated at the last reported sale or settlement price on the day of valuation. To the extent these securities are actively traded and valuation adjustments are not applied, they are categorized as Level1 of the fair value hierarchy. Valuation adjustments may be applied to certain securities that are solely traded on a foreign exchange to account for the market movement between the close of the foreign market and the NYSE Close. These securities are valued using Pricing Services that consider the correlation of the trading patterns of the foreign security to the intraday trading in the U.S. markets for investments. Securities using these valuation adjustments are categorized as Level2 of the fair value hierarchy. Preferred securities and other equities traded on inactive markets or valued by reference to similar instruments are also categorized as Level2 of the fair value hierarchy. Investments in registered open-end investment companies (other than ETFs) will be valued based upon the NAVs of such investments and are categorized as Level1 of the fair value hierarchy. Investments in unregistered open-end investment companies will be calculated based upon the NAVs of such investments and are considered Level1 provided that the NAVs are observable, calculated daily and are the value at which both purchases and sales will be conducted. Investments in privately held investment funds with significant restrictions on redemption where the inputs to the NAVs are observable will be valued based upon the NAVs of such investments and are categorized as Level2 of the fair value hierarchy. Short-term debt instruments (such as commercial paper) having a remaining maturity of 60 days or less may be valued at amortized cost, so long as the amortized cost of such short-term debt instrument is approximately the same as the fair value of the instrument as determined without the use of amortized cost valuation. Equity exchange-traded options and over the counter financial derivative instruments, such as forward foreign currency contracts, options contracts, or swap agreements, derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates, and other inputs or a combination of these factors. Other than swap agreements, which are valued using a broker-dealer bid quotation or on market-based prices provided by Pricing Services or other pricing sources, these contracts are normally valued on the basis of quotes obtained from a quotation reporting system, established market makers or Pricing Services (normally determined as of the NYSE Close). Depending on the product and the terms of the transaction, financial derivative instruments can be valued by Pricing Services using a series of techniques, including simulation pricing models. The pricing models use inputs that are observed from actively quoted markets such as quoted prices, issuer details, indices, bid/ask spreads, interest rates, implied volatilities, yield curves, dividends and exchange rates. Financial derivative instruments that use similar valuation techniques and inputs as described above are categorized as Level2 of the fair value hierarchy. Centrally cleared swaps listed or traded on a multilateral or trade facility platform, such as a registered exchange, are valued at the daily settlement price determined by the respective exchange (if available). For centrally cleared credit default swaps the clearing facility requires its members to provide actionable price levels across complete term structures. These levels along with external third-party prices are used to produce daily settlement prices. These securities are categorized as Level2 of the fair value hierarchy. Centrally cleared interest rate swaps are valued using a pricing model that references the underlying rates including the overnight index swap rate and London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) forward rate to produce the daily settlement price. These securities are categorized as Level2 of the fair value hierarchy. Level3 trading assets and trading liabilities, at fair value When a fair valuation method is applied by the Adviser that uses significant unobservable inputs, investments will be priced by a method that the Board or persons acting at their direction believe reflects fair value and are categorized as Level3 of the fair value hierarchy. The valuation techniques and significant inputs used in determining the fair values of portfolio assets and liabilities categorized as Level3 of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Proxy pricing procedures set the base price of a fixed income security and subsequently adjust the price proportionally to market value changes of a pre-determined security deemed to be comparable in duration, generally a U.S. Treasury or sovereign note based on country of issuance. The base price may be a broker-dealer quote, transaction price, or an internal value as derived by analysis of market data. The base price of the security may be reset on a periodic basis based on the availability of market data and procedures approved by the Valuation Oversight Committee. Significant changes in the unobservable inputs of the proxy pricing process (the base price) would result in direct and proportional changes in the fair value of the security. These securities are categorized as Level3 of the fair value hierarchy. If third-party evaluated vendor pricing is not available or not deemed to be indicative of fair value, the Adviser may elect to obtain indicative market quotations (Broker Quotes) directly from the broker-dealer or passed through from a third-party vendor. In the event that fair value is based upon a single sourced Broker Quote, these securities are categorized as Level3 of the fair value hierarchy. Broker Quotes are typically received from established market participants. Although independently received, the Adviser does not have the transparency to view the underlying inputs which support the market quotation. Significant changes in the Broker Quote would have direct and proportional changes in the fair value of the security. Discounted cash flow valuation uses an internal analysis based on the Advisers expectation of future income and expenses, capital structure, exit multiples of a security, and other unobservable inputs which may include contractual and factual loan factors, estimated future payments and credit rating. Significant changes in the unobservable inputs of the models would result in direct and proportional changes in the fair value of the security. These securities are categorized as Level3 of the fair value hierarchy. Market comparable valuation estimates fair value by applying a valuation multiple to a key performance metric of the company, which may include unobservable inputs such as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), the Advisers assumptions regarding comparable companies and non-public statements from the underlying company. Reference instrument valuation estimates fair value by utilizing the correlation of the security to one or more broad-based securities, market indices, and/or other financial instruments, whose pricing information is readily available. Unobservable inputs may include those used in algorithm formulas based on percentage change in the reference instruments and/or weights of each reference instrument. Significant changes in the unobservable inputs would result in direct and proportional changes in the fair value of the security. These securities are categorized as Level3 of the fair value hierarchy. The validity of the fair value is reviewed by the Adviser on a periodic basis and may be amended in accordance with the Fund valuation procedures. 3. FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS Each Fund intends to qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) and distribute all of its taxable income and net realized gains, if applicable, to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision for Federal income taxes has been made. A Fund may be subject to local withholding taxes, including those imposed on realized capital gains. Any applicable foreign capital gains tax is accrued daily based upon net unrealized gains, and may be payable following the sale of any applicable investments. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Adviser has reviewed the Funds tax positions for all open tax years. As of December31, 2016, the Funds have recorded no liability for net unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain income tax positions they have taken or expect to take in future tax returns. The Funds file U.S. tax returns. While the statute of limitations remains open to examine the Funds U.S. tax returns filed for the fiscal years ending in 2013-2016, no examinations are in progress or anticipated at this time. The Funds are not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months The PIMCO CommoditiesPLUS Strategy Fund, PIMCO CommodityRealReturn Strategy Fund, PIMCO Global Multi-Asset Fund, PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset Fund and PIMCO TRENDS Managed Futures Strategy Fund may gain exposure to the commodities markets primarily through index-linked notes, and may invest in other commodity-linked derivative instruments, including commodity swap agreements, options, futures contracts, options on futures contracts and foreign funds investing in similar commodity-linked derivatives. One of the requirements for favorable tax treatment as a regulated investment company under the Code is that a Fund derive at least 90% of its gross income from certain qualifying sources of income. The IRS has issued a revenue ruling which holds that income derived from commodity index-linked swaps is not qualifying income under Subchapter M of the Code. The IRS has also issued private letter rulings in which the IRS specifically concluded that income from certain commodity index-linked notes is qualifying income. The IRS has also issued private rulings in which the IRS specifically concluded that income derived from investment in a subsidiary, which invests primarily in commodity index-linked swaps, will also be qualifying income. Based on such rulings, the PIMCO CommoditiesPLUS Strategy Fund, PIMCO CommodityRealReturn Strategy Fund, PIMCO Global Multi-Asset Fund, PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset Fund and PIMCO TRENDS Managed Futures Strategy Fund will continue to seek to gain exposure to the commodity markets primarily through investments in commodity-linked notes and through investments in its subsidiary. It should be noted, however, that the IRS currently has suspended the issuance of such rulings pending further review. In addition, the IRS also recently issued a revenue procedure, which states that the IRS will not in the future issue private letter rulings that would require a determination of whether an asset (such as a commodity index-linked note) is a security under the 1940 Act. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not change its position that income derived from commodity-linked notes and wholly-owned subsidiaries is qualifying income. Furthermore, the tax treatment of commodity linked notes, other commodity-linked derivatives, and the Funds investments in the Subsidiary may otherwise be adversely affected by future legislation, Treasury Regulations and/or guidance issued by the IRS. Such developments could affect the character, timing and/or amount of the Funds taxable income or any distributions made by the Fund or result in the inability of the Fund to operate as described in its Prospectus. The IRS recently issued proposed regulations that, if finalized, would generally treat the Funds income inclusion with respect to a Subsidiary as qualifying income only if there is a distribution out of the earnings and profits of the Subsidiary that are attributable to such income inclusion. The proposed regulations, if adopted, would apply to taxable years beginning on or after 90 days after the regulations are published as final. If, during a taxable year, a subsidiary incurs taxable losses (and other deductible items) exceeding its income and gains, the net loss will not pass through to the PIMCO CommoditiesPLUS Strategy Fund, PIMCO CommodityRealReturn Strategy Fund , PIMCO Global Multi-Asset Fund, PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset Fund and PIMCO TRENDS Managed Futures Strategy Fund as a deductible amount for Federal income tax purposes. Note that the loss from a subsidiarys contemplated activities also cannot be carried forward to reduce future subsidiary income in subsequent years. However, if a subsidiarys taxable gains exceed its losses and other deductible items during a taxable year, the net gain will pass through to the PIMCO CommoditiesPLUS Short Strategy Fund, PIMCO CommoditiesPLUS Strategy Fund, PIMCO CommodityRealReturn Strategy Fund, PIMCO Global Multi-Asset Fund, PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset Fund and PIMCO TRENDS Managed Futures Strategy Fund as income for Federal income tax purposes. To the extent a Fund invests in the PIMCO CommoditiesPLUS Strategy Fund, PIMCO CommodityRealReturn Strategy Fund, PIMCO Global Multi-Asset Fund, PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset Fund and PIMCO TRENDS Managed Futures Strategy Fund, the Fund may be subject to additional tax risk.
